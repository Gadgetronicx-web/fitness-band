Author: Nihar Gupta from www.gadgetronicx.com

Fitness band is a open source project that uses heart beat sensor to measure heart beat and translate them into calories burned for a given duration. 

This system uses heart beat sensor to measure the activity of heart in Beats per minute ( BPM ). Heart beat is a key parameter to understand physical activity. When perform any physical activity our heart rate goes high and when we relax heart beat will be back to normal. This makes heart beat a great parameter to understand the number of calories burned. Along with heart beat rate we require other parameters such as gender, age and weight of user. These parameters will help us to deduce the calories burnt for a given time.

Features:
1. Calculates average heartbeat rate in BPM(bits per minute).
2. Determines and updates total calories burnt in the cloud for every 10 seconds.
3. User can control when to start and stop the fitness bands activity through IOT application or Smartphone.
4. Sends an alert email to the user about the average heart beat (BPM) and calories burnt.
5. LED indicator that blinks in relation to the speed of user heart beat.
